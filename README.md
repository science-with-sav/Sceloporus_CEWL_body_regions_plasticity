Cutaneous evaporative water loss in lizards is variable across body regions and plastic in response to humidity. Herpetologica.

The figures and model results presented in the paper can be found in the "final_figures" and "best_models" folders within this repository, respectively.

The "capture_analysis" files are for the analyses of baseline variation in cutaneous evaporative water loss, plasma osmolality, and hematocrit. This portain of the study was a course-based undergraduate research experience in the Cal Poly Herpetology class in spring 2021, taught by Dr. Emily Taylor.

The "experiment_analysis" files are for the analysis of plasticity of cutaneous evaporative water loss, plasma osmolality, hematocrit, and body condition in response to acclimation to either dry or humid climate treatments.

The "HOBO_analysis" files are for quantifying the variation in temperature and humidity between the dry versus humid treatment groups and among trials of the experiment. 

Readers of the paper and users of this code are encouraged to email questions to Savannah Weaver at savannahjweaver@gmail.com.
